# 🦵 Knee Osteoarthritis Classification 🩺

*A Machine Learning-based approach for automated detection and classification of knee osteoarthritis from X-ray images*

## 📋 About the Project

This project focuses on developing a Machine Learning model to classify the severity of **knee osteoarthritis (OA)** using radiographic (X-ray) images. Knee OA is a common degenerative joint disease, and early diagnosis can help improve patient outcomes. Our solution leverages image processing and classification algorithms to assist medical professionals in the diagnosis process.
